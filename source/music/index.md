Sometime around 1999 or 2000, I decided that I wanted to try to write some music of my own. At that time, my primary listening choices were Trance and Electronica from that period, most notibly, musicians like Orbital, Sasha, Paul van Dyk, and a number of 1-off performers and DJs (Energy 52 or Binary Finary, for example). My initial foray into this world involved the use of a loop-based sequencer for Windows-based PCs, called FruityLoops. This program has developed immensely since I used it, and has probably become a much more professional tool than it was when I started using it almost 10 years ago. I played with Fruity loops on and off, the last time being some time around 2003 or 2004.

I collaborated a bit with my friend, Lindsay Auten, who also used the program. She produced some interesting pieces, which I will also include on this page. We had intended to operate under the stage name "AMDM", but that never fully materialized.
Later on, I found a program called Bhajis Loops, which runs on Palm OS. Since I have a Treo phone, I've been using this program to play around in my spare time. I don't have any songs that have been completed, but I have come up with a few themes.
